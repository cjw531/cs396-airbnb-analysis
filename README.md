In order to provide more insights to users, Airbnb data on New York City have been utilized to perform a multi-dimensional analysis. The analysis contains general exploratory data analysis, statistical and machine learning models to provide the best intuition.

This work was done for the course <em>CS396: Introduction to the Data Science Pipeline</em> at [Northwestern Univeristy](https://www.northwestern.edu/).
